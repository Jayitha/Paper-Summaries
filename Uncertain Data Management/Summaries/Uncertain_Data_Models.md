## Definition

- An **uncertain database** asserts that a database is in one of multiple alternative states (possible worlds), each being a standard database.

-  A probability distribution can be assigned to the set of possible worlds.

 - An uncertain database can be captured by **possible worlds semantics**. An uncertain relational database can be thought of as a (possibly uncountably infinite) set of possible worlds, each possible world a classical relational database, which all adhere to the same schema.
